## Fast.BI Data Platform CI/CD Workflows

This repository provides Argo Workflows and CI/CD templates to build, test, validate, and deploy Fast.BI data platform assets across branches, merge requests, and main releases.

- **Repository name**: `data-platform-cicd-workflows`
- **Scope**: Orchestrate CI/CD for data applications, dbt artifacts, DAGs, and maintenance jobs
- **Stack**: Argo Workflows (YAML), Bash scripts, GitHub/GitLab CI templates; integrates with Terraform/Terragrunt infra

## Overview

Standardized workflows for the Fast.BI data platform:
- **Branch CI**: fast feedback (linting, tests, selective compilation, PVC cleanup)
- **Merge Request E2E**: full end-to-end validations prior to merge
- **Main**: promotion flows (compilations, governance imports, quality checks)
- **Maintenance**: reusable steps and cleanup jobs

## Architecture

Argo Workflows on Kubernetes orchestrate containerized steps executing scripts from `0_branch/`, `1_merge_request/`, and `2_main/`.

- **Branch Workflow (`branch_workflow.yaml`)**: fast, incremental checks for feature branches
- **MR E2E Workflow (`mr_e2e_workflow.yaml`)**: comprehensive validations and end-to-end tests
- **Main Workflow (`main_workflow.yaml`)**: promotion and scheduled pipeline runs on `main`
- **CI Templates**: GitHub/GitLab snippets to trigger Argo workflows consistently

## Using the CI Templates

### GitLab

```yaml
include:
  - local: "fast_bi_argo_workflows/template.gitlab.gitlab-ci.yml"

variables:
  ARGO_NAMESPACE: "argo"

mr_e2e:
  extends: .fast_bi_argo_workflows
  variables:
    WORKFLOW_FILE: "fast_bi_argo_workflows/mr_e2e_workflow.yaml"
```

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: MR E2E
on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  mr-e2e:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/template.argo-workflows.yml
    with:
      workflow_file: fast_bi_argo_workflows/mr_e2e_workflow.yaml
      argo_namespace: argo
```

## Common Workflow Inputs

- `ARGO_NAMESPACE`: Argo namespace (e.g., `argo`)
- `WORKFLOW_FILE`: Path to the workflow YAML
- `GIT_REF` / `COMMIT_SHA`: ref for checkout steps
- `REGISTRY`, `IMAGE_TAG`: image registry and tag
- `DBT_PROJECT_DIR`, `DAG_DIR`: paths for model and orchestration artifacts

## Main Functionality

- **Branch CI**: lint YAML/SQL, detect changes, validate dependencies, compile DAG/dbt manifest, PVC cleanup
- **MR E2E**: end-to-end data model validations, tagging, orchestration variable imports, cleanup
- **Main**: production compilations, data catalog/governance imports, data quality deployments, incremental refresh helpers

## Testing

Run workflows via Argo with parameters:

```bash
argo submit fast_bi_argo_workflows/mr_e2e_workflow.yaml \
  -n ${ARGO_NAMESPACE:-argo} \
  -p git_ref=${GIT_REF:-HEAD} \
  --watch
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Stuck/Pending**: check controller and pod events (`kubectl describe wf/<name>`)
- **PVC issues**: use `0_branch/k8s-pvc-cleanup.sh`
- **Missing variables**: verify CI variables and Argo parameters
